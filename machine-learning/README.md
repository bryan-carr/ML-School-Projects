# Read Me for Machine Learning Credit Score Analysis project
June, 2025

## Description
This is a project to determine the credit worthyness of loan applicants - if an applicant is likely to default on loan payments, given their hsitory and other personal factors.
This was done for my Machine Learning course at the University of San Diego, as part of my Masters in Applied Artificial Intelligence degree.
The course took one dataset and stuck with it throughout the course, applying different machine learning methods and techniques. I had a little previous experience with ML, so I tried to push into areas that I was still learning about (different imputation techniques, and more advanced models like XGBoost).

## Dataset
The dataset is a Home Credit Default Risk dataset, from a previous Kaggle competition. Available here:

## Areas for Improvement
This was done in 2022, earlier in my coding and machine learning adventures. At the time, I was mostly used to simple single-file data sets, such as the Titanic or Iris data. This dataset has a star schema, with linkages between different files. I therefore did not make much use of the secondary files, sticking mainly to the 'main' data file, which deals with applicants' personal factors (job, home, income, whether they have other loans, etc). I could have made much better use of the historical data in those secondary files, and also investigated time-series techniques (though those were not covered).

### Assignment 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
### Assignment 2 - Decision Trees and Random Forests
### Assignment 3 - Unsupervised Methods (Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Clustering and Dendographs, K-Means Clustering)
### Assignment 4 - Feature Selection, Imputing and Feature Engineering - deeper dives into cleaning and filling Nulls, and the importance of features
### Assignment 5 - Bayesian Methods, Naive Bayes
### Final Assignment -- putting it all together, including building a Classification model with XGBoost
