Assignments and Projects from my MS, 2021-2023

/machine-learning :
Assignment files from my Machine Learning course. Course followed a home credit risk dataset from Kaggle all the way through, using different techniques on it.
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data

Assignment 1: EDA

Assignment 2: Decision Trees and Random Forests

Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning; k-means clustering; Agglomerative clustering; PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

Assignment 4: Feature Selection & Engineering; Data Cleaning/Munging; Imputation; dealing with Imbalanced Data

Assignment 5: Bayesian Methods; Naive Bayes classifier

Final Project: Putting many of the techniques together into an XGB Classifier


/deep-learning:
Deep Learning class.

Assignment 2: Basic linear neural network, on simplified housing price dataset

Assignment 3: Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST digit recognition task

Assignment 4: Recurrent Neural Network for stock price prediction (mine all overfit, but this is a bad task for a neural network without some additional features to help in the prediction)

Assignment 5: NLP and Sentiment Analysis - predicting sentiment of IMDB movie reviews

Assignment 6: Autoencoder - building a CNN autoencoder for the MINST handwritten digits we used earlier

Assingment 7: Recommender Systems - Building user-movie recommender systems based on the ML-100k Movielens movie rating dataset



/iot :
Final project files from my Internet of Things course. I built a multi-class classifier with XG Boost on the Spotify Songs dataset. Then built a small Streamlit wrapper to control model generation, and a file to launch it all. In retrospect, should have made the wrapper do something simpler, like load a saved model and print results graphs from it.


/nlp : Natural Language Processing class. Assignments usink NLTK and spaCy for NLP tasks.

Assignment 2: NLP basics with spaCy. Counting tokens, sentences, searching for tokens, etc.

Assignment 4: Topic Analysis on a dataset of text questions

Assignment 5 - Parts of Speech identification and analysis; dependancy trees

Assignment 7/final project: Topic Modelling revisited, on a dataset of classic writing. The Test+Train data are for this assignment
